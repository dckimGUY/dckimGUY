# Is Now The Time to Learn Markdown?

It's so minimal, I guess it's impossible not to learn and use it. What's really good about it is that it is fast, and it visually represents what the page will look like when it is rendered, so there's no real purpose in having a preview.

## Here we go! Spicing it up with Markdown!

Is it okay if I use custom breaklines? Black and white is always fast right? OKAY!

I am starting to think that it might be good to do almost all of my inline HTML work in Markdown. There isn't much that Markdown doesn't cover. Then, I could come along for the second pass through the HTML after it's converted. Is that the strategy generally?

I should try to keep on topic, this README.md is supposed to be used as my 'User-Profile' page. I am supposed to tell about myself, right?

## How has my computer programming journey been going so far?

That's a really good question: "Where did I start and what have I worked through?"

I have been busy working away at HTML/Javascript/CSS...

First, about a year ago, I was working hard at learning to write using HTML. I had no idea what I was doing but, the syntax seemed simple enough. You just plunk down some angly-bracket looking things like this '<' or this '>' and then the HTML kinda magically appears in the browser if you end the file name '.html', right? Seems easy... Turns out it's not easy at all. It's a mess of non-sense looking code that you can barely tell where the things your are writing will end up. The only part that really makes sense to me from it is the 'in-line' semantic type of HTML. That's the stuff that decides what is a separate paragraph, where bold text is, the normal writing type of stuff.

When I first started out with HTML, I was writing all of the styling inside of the HTML element using the 'style="' type of stuff. I didn't really understand how 'classes' worked, or why I should use them. As it turns out, if you are doing everything wrong, the HTML still renders pretty quickly as long as you put all of the styles inside of the HTML. Blazing-fast, even if you have tonnes of HTML in there. For various reasons it makes absolutely no sense to write it that way... but my secret weapon was helping me to do it the bad way.

At the same time that I was learning HTML, I was also learning to use both BASH and VI. Yes those 'ancient-computer-technologies'. Strange how they are both completely relevant even after such a long time. Nothing has really exceeded BASH, and no text editor has exceeded VI. Those are simply the best available development software.

BASH and VI fit together like a pair of gloves. Even so as it's tough to start working with VI in the beginning. For me, it wasn't so bad, because I was learning typing also at the same time, and I was horribly out of practice.

After using VI, and having all of those advantages available, I soon learned to wrangle HTML with brute force, and press out HTML with the help of 'regular expressions'.

## At first, I learned only enough JavaScript to copy one HTML element's innerHTML to another one.

This might seem like a silly thing to do in the first place. "Why don't you just use variables and things like that?"

I simply did not know about those things yet, and I am a very stubborn person, who only wanted to work through it with what I already knew about. My strategy was to 'avoid learning'. I can only work through so many things at once in my mind so, I thought it was better to work through each problem gradually, and only incorporate new concepts if absolutely necessary. This might seem dumb and ignorant and unecessary. That is a reasoned assessment: True.

A more thoughtful consideration might be that, no matter how much 'program languaging' anyone does, all of it is reducible to a 'Turing-Machine' anyhow. So, having fewer parts was, at that time, easier for my early learning. It kept the learning curve from becoming prohibitively steep. My strategy, which continues today, is to bring in additional concepts gradually. That way I can try to make sure that I have a solid grasp of the most foundational ones before mixing in more concepts that might confuse what I have learned earlier.

## It gives me a very solid approach to learning.

I proceeded very slowly at first, while striving to complete what seemed like a difficult project. It all started with a program that was written mostly with HTML, and very little JavaScript. And all of the CSS was inside of the HTML elements. Weird... I know. My perspective today has me wondering: "What was I thinking back then?"

I know, looking back, that I could not have possibly learned all of what I know now without following a carefully laid path.

A program that does everything that I could imagine! Yes, it was ambitious for me at that point, seeing as I knew very little of JavaScript. What is very interesting is what marvelous things were possible with only the littlest bit of JavaScript. An organizational multi-tool program. Twenty-five tabs total, five tabs per row. It worked right on my phone...

I used that quirky little program, which was some-how, some-way, in the order of five megabytes. It could translate things directly using the browser, and then save the translated text. I could translate my entire website into 125 different languages! So, I set up the program around that premise! That way I could have the search engines indexing 125 times the content! I just had to submit each page as a request...

## That was the start of my programming journey... but it went right on from there.

This little project has become the centre of my world. From the earliest stages of the development of this project I have always found myself willing to experiment with possibilities and outcomes. This project is exceptional and unique because it has been almost exclusively comprised of computer code that interacts directly with the user.

There are so many different types of computer programming, and most of the programming work that happens is never actually seen by the end user. The programs, which are the most vital, they are actually 'running-code' behind the scenes and the user never 'sees' it.

This is the advantage of writing a program which seeks to unlock the world of HTML Drafting: The codework is almost always visual. So, the debugging process is also almost completely visual. (at the start)

It's like the cake has already been baked up nice and fluffy by the bakers, and I'm the guy who gets to come in and do all of the sugary icing work for the delicious cake. If you have seen the program, you will know that I have been using three colours for this fabulous icing-sugar.

To tell a little more about myself, without revealing my 'true-identity': I can tell you that I am a Red-Seal Carpenter and that I live in East Gwillimbury Ontario.

Building a computer program is a lot like carpentry work. Everything relies completely on the foundation. Selecting the foundational structure has the effect of completely determining what can be built upon those footings. If we think carefully, we start taking the view that everything is 'like-a-foundation' in the sense that it has the potential to restrict or allow certain outcomes 'down-the-line'.

Finally, there is a consideration of combination of foundational elements: Through this we see the 'big-picture', and uncover what we were designing all along.

Now I will 'cut-it-short' and get back to 'hammering-down' some more code!
