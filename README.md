It's just a wonder that I haven't ventured into 'markdown' yet. I have been busy working away at HTML/Javascript/CSS...

This little project has become the centre of my world. From the earliest stages of the development of this project I have always found myself willing to experiment with possibilities and outcomes. This project is exceptional and unique because it has been almost exclusively comprised of computer code that interacts directly with the user.

There are so many different types of computer programming, and most of the programming work that happens is never actually seen by the end user. The programs, which are the most vital, they are actually 'running-code' behind the scenes and the user never 'sees' it.

This is the advantage of writing a program which seeks to unlock the world of HTML Drafting: The codework is almost always visual. So, the debugging process is also almost completely visual. (at the start)

It's like the cake has already been baked up nice and fluffy by the bakers, and I'm the guy who gets to come in and do all of the sugary icing work for the delicious cake. If you have seen the program, you will know that I have been using three colours for this fabulous icing-sugar.

To tell a little more about myself, without revealing my 'true-identity': I can tell you that I am a Red-Seal Carpenter and that I live in East Gwillimbury Ontario.

Building a computer program is a lot like carpentry work. Everything relies completely on the foundation. Selecting the foundational structure has the effect of completely determining what can be built upon those footings. If we think carefully, we start taking the view that everything is 'like-a-foundation' in the sense that it has the potential to restrict or allow certain outcomes 'down-the-line'.

Finally, there is a consideration of combination of foundational elements: Through this we see the 'big-picture', and uncover what we were designing all along.

Now I will 'cut-it-short' and get back to 'hammering-down' some more code!
